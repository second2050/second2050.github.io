<h1>My Setup:</h1>
<p>I currently (as of summer 2024) use <a href="https://archlinux.org">󰣇&nbsp;Arch Linux</a> with the <a
        href="https://somegit.dev/ALHP/ALHP.GO">&nbsp;ALHP x86-64-v3</a> repositories. AUR Access is managed
    with a
    self-hosted auto building server (using <a href="https://github.com/alexheretic/aurto">&nbsp;aurto</a>)
    which
    allows me to use it on multiple devices and saves me time by building even when my devices are off,
    especially on my laptop.</p>
<p>As my desktop environment I use <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">&nbsp;KDE Plasma</a> with the
    KDE
    Application Suite. Most of my time is in the terminal tho, where I use <a
        href="https://zellij.dev">&nbsp;Zellij</a> as my terminal multiplexer, <a
        href="https://fishshell.com">󰈺&nbsp;fish</a> as my shell and <a href="https://starship.rs">󱓞&nbsp;Starship</a>
    for my prompt.</p>
<p>For my coding, and typesetting, needs I use <a href="https://neovim.io">&nbsp;neovim</a> with way too many
    plugins to list here.</p>
<p>My dotfiles can be found on <a href="https://github.com/second2050/dotfiles">&nbsp;GitHub</a>.
<h1>My Hardware:</h1>
<h2>On the go</h2>
<p>As my portable workstation I use the, already pretty old, Lenovo ThinkPad T440p. Mine is equipped with an
    Intel Core i7 4710MQ, 12GB of RAM and the dedicated Nvidia GeForce GT730M + the 1080p IPS display. It also
    got the LTE modem and Smartcard reader included</p>
<p>I flashed an unlocked BIOS (<a href="https://notthebe.ee/blog/removing-the-wifi-whitelist/">Guide by
        Wolfgang</a>) on it and upgraded the WiFi card to an Intel AX210. The CPU is also undervolted
    for better battery life which more or less works.</p>
<p>The unlocked BIOS might be replaced with Libreboot in the future.</p>
<h2>At home</h2>
<p>My workstation at home is a custom built computer based on AMD's AM4 Platform, it currently runs with the
    following hardware:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
    <li>32GB (4×8GB) HyperX Fusion RAM</li>
    <li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070</li>
    <li>Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi Titanium</li>
    <li>2TB Crucial P2 (NVMe SSD)</li>
    <li>6TB of HDD Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>This computer is mostly used for gaming and it runs a dual-boot setup with Arch Linux and Windows, which I
    use for work and gaming respectively.</p>
<p>For my peripherals I use the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-huntsman-elite">󰌌&nbsp;Huntsman
        Elite</a>, <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-keypads/razer-tartarus-pro">󰌌&nbsp;Tartarus Pro</a> and
    <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200621220904/https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-lancehead-tournament-edition">󰍽&nbsp;Lancehead
        Tournament Edition</a> by Razer. Additionally I use the <a
        href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/dualshock-4-wireless-controller">󰊴&nbsp;DualShock
        4</a> and
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/Steam_Controller/">󰊴&nbsp;Steam Controller</a>.
