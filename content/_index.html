    shift almost quarterly.</p>

<h2>ArchLinux Install Scripts</h2>
<p>Script I use to quickly install ArchLinux on my PCs. They are mostly interactive and aren't meant to fully
    automate the process, the repository is quite messy but should work as long as you check what the Scripts
    themselves do (which you should always do).<br> <a href="https://github.com/second2050/arch-install-scripts">
