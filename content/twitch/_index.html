<h1>About my streams:</h1>
<p>I mostly play JRPGs, I am also planning on playing some multiplayer sandbox games and racing
    games. I would be happy to also talk to people while playing these games.</p>
<p>These streams are not strictly
    single language streams, as I talk a mix of German and English. I try to make my streams watchable for
    people who speak either language.</p>
<p>My streaming schedule is visible on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/second2050"> Twitch</a> channel and on my
    <a href="https://discord.gg/KKYtNs534A">
        Discord</a>
